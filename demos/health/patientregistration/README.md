## ReadMe for Patient Registration demo

This demo will involve MORF, Power automate, Sharepoint, PDF Document Generation Service and Adobe Acrobat Sign.

Upon submission from Morf form, it will merge the data to a word template(stored in a sharepoint folder) using Document Generation API service. These are all processed and automated in Power Automate. 

After hitting submit, the end user is then forwarded directly to the signing page in Adobe Acrobat Sign. Then a second signer will counter sign after via opening e-sign request email.
